# Nouveau
A next generation art and simulation programming language. My hope is that people will use Nouveau and share it with other people, or embed it within their projects and make other people aware of it, or maybe even fork or contribute to Nouveau. I believe that knowledge is power, and knowledge should be free. I've chosen the MIT license for this language as a symbol of it's dedication to be used as a paintbrush or pencil would.

# Artists First
Nouveau has one design goal: to be a simple and accessible language for creating efficient, structured communication between each of the standard peripherals used for interaction in the fields of game design and simulation. The first projects built in Nouveau will be libraries for SDL2 and it will compile Vulkan and Spir-V

# The Short Version

# The Language
Nouveau is a dynamic, pure functional, homoiconic, post-fix, process calculus programming language. Nouveau is lisp-like, but instead of a list (s-expression) used in the lisp family of languages, Nouveau has a tensor type spelled `[tensor]` or `scalar` which is  where the 'hello world' looks like `[[hello world] std !]`.
